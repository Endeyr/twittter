# README

Followed along with Andy Leverenz's twitter clone guide found at https://github.com/justalever/twittter.

"The app itself will feature a basic CRUD principle where we can create, read, update, and destroy Tweeets. In essence, this is the same as my previous build where we created posts for a blog. On top of the Tweeets, I introduce a new gem called Devise which makes creating an entire user role and authentication system easy. Combined with this gem we can authenticate users who want to author Tweeets. A user's Tweeets are then also tied to their account. The end result is a public facing site with a stream of tweets from different users. Users that have and account can login to create their own Tweeets to add to the public stream."
